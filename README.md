# Course Scheduling Planner using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to build an intelligent course scheduling system that optimizes students' academic schedules based on RateMyProfessor reviews, prerequisites, and major requirements. By leveraging deep learning and sentiment analysis, the system will recommend optimal quarterly schedules that maximize both academic success and student satisfaction.

## Features  
- **AI-Powered Course Scheduling**  
  - Utilizes **prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and fine-tuning of pretrained models**. 
  - Implements **transformers and Google LLMs** for enhanced decision-making.  
- **Data Collection & Analysis**  
  - Extracts **Rate My Professor reviews** for professor insights.  
  - Integrates **course prerequisites and major requirements** to ensure schedule feasibility.  
  - Uses **natural language processing (NLP)** for sentiment analysis on professor reviews.  
- **Optimized Recommendations**  
  - Balances course difficulty, professor ratings, and major progression.  
  - Suggests schedules based on historical data and user preferences.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Deep Learning & AI**: Transformers, Google LLMs, RAG, fine-tuning techniques  
- **NLP & Sentiment Analysis**: Text preprocessing, sentiment extraction from Rate My Professor reviews  
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Backend & APIs**: Python, FastAPI (if applicable)  
- **Frontend **: Next.js or another UI framework
