# Course Scheduling Planner using Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to build an intelligent course scheduling system that optimizes students' academic schedules based on RateMyProfessor reviews, prerequisites, and major requirements. By leveraging deep learning and sentiment analysis, the system will recommend optimal quarterly schedules that maximize both academic success and student satisfaction.
